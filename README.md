# AI_Projects

Welcome to **AI_Projects**, a collection of practical AI-powered projects demonstrating skills in FastAPI, Large Language Models (LLMs), RAG pipelines, and data management systems. Each project is self-contained with its own code, README, and documentation.

## üìÇ Projects Included

### 1. Student Management API

A simple REST API for managing student records. It allows you to add, view, update, and delete students. All data is stored in-memory, and each student gets a unique ID and timestamp automatically.

**Key Features:**
- CRUD operations for student data
- Unique ID and timestamp generation
- Built with FastAPI and Pydantic
- Fully testable via Swagger UI

**Technologies Used:** FastAPI, Pydantic, Uvicorn, UUID, Datetime

### 2. IntelliCourse Advisor

An AI-powered course advisor that helps students make intelligent course decisions using RAG pipelines and LLMs. It can answer queries like prerequisites, course content, or interdisciplinary course suggestions.

**Key Features:**
- Context-aware course recommendations
- Multi-tool AI agent using LangGraph
- Semantic search with ChromaDB + Sentence Transformers
- REST API with FastAPI
- LLM-powered responses via Google Gemini

**Technologies Used:** FastAPI, LangChain, LangGraph, ChromaDB, Google Gemini, Hugging Face Embeddings
